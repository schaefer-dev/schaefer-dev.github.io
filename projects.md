## University Projects

- "Software Praktikum": implementation of a fully fledged turn-based game including GUI. Won price for best additional feature with a fully automatic map-generation that used image processing on topographic maps fetched from Google Maps, that allowed to play your game on a realistic map of e.g. Hawaii or Greenland.
- Plagiarism detection tool, developed for professor at Saarland University. The tool is now successfully used to detect plagiarism cases among students and supports up to 4000 submissions with up to 1000 lines each and checks every submission pair for possible plagiarism cases. Obvious plagiarism cases are highlighted and the professor is automatically notified with a human readable overview of why the set of submissions are obvious plagiarism cases including a colored mapping of copied parts of the code. The tool is completely robust against many options to easily bypass most ordinary plagiarism detection tools for both python and C code (variable renaming, moving of code blocks etc.).
- Implementation of Pintos Operating System - Threads, Virtual Memory, Scheduling and Filesystem Implementation
- Bachelor Thesis: My Thesis [Development and Evalutation of Authentication Schemes for Mobile Virtual Reality](https://schaefer-dev.de/thesis.pdf) was featured in the selection of outstanding Thesis at the Ubiquitous Media Technology Lab.
- Embedded Systems Project: Won tournament of all student-teams.
Detailed description will follow at a later date.
- Research Assistant Project: TREX Roboter C Code on a arduino with variety of sensors that communicates via self-implemented USB interface with Rust Code running on a Intel NUC built on top of the roboter chassis. Additionally a small Lidar is connected to the NUC to be able to scan and reconstruct the room surrounding the robot. Goal of the project: Interface for Synthesis of Autonomous Robots

## Freetime Projects
