# About Myself

<img class="profile-picture" src="me.jpg">

Hi! My name is Daniel and I am a German M.Sc. Computer Science student at University of Saarland, Saarbruecken and currently in the process of writing my masters thesis in the field of synthesis at the [Reactive Systems Group](https://www.react.uni-saarland.de).


## Short Bio

My main interests at university are the fields of embedded systems and operating systems and verification of such systems. However, I intentionally visted a broad selection of courses at university to develop skills in a variety of fields.

I very much enjoy the 'challenge' of writing 'low-level' code. In my time as a student this usually resulted in me writing efficient Code in C. Recently I discovered Rust which sparked my interest a couple of times already in the past, mainly because of the strong guarantees (safe) rust code gives by design while getting reasonably close to C performance. This time I actually gave it a serious shot and so far I have been really happy with my decision.

In my free time, I like to keep myself in shape by exercising regularly at home - particularly my back is very thankful for those breaks after hours of sitting in a chair. I would consider myself very passionate about a wide variety of music and audio gear, which also helps me relax after a long day of working if im not reading a book on my Kindle. One of my favorite things to do after university is to optimize my workflow, for the tasks I am currently facing. This mainly ends up in me fine-tuning my zsh, tmux, vim or vscode configurations to solve some annoyance I encountered that day.

I used to be a quite unorganized and spontaneous person, but a couple of years ago I read about the principle of "Getting Things Done" by David Allen. Nowadays there is no way I leave the house without a way of putting down my thoughts (usually ends up being watch or phone) which helps me to organize and plan my week properly. This step forward had a significant impact not only on my overall enjoyment of working but also resulted in me being way more productive in the same amount of time.

The only hobby that still survived from my early childhood is gaming. I have never really enjoyed single-player games, but always had a great time playing PC games with my friends, which I occasionally still do. I like to keep up to date with some eSports as competitive gaming still is a passion of mine despite not having the time to pursue in that hobby myself anymore.

During Semester breaks I love traveling to new countries and discovering new places I haven't been at before.

A detailed description of what I have been up to in recent years will follow here shortly :)
