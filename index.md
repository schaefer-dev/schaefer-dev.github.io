# About Myself

<img class="profile-picture" src="me.jpg">

Hi! My name is Daniel and I am a product Engineer at paragon semvox. I finished my masters in Computer Science at University of Saarland, Saarbruecken in Oktober of 2020 with an average grade of 1.4. My thesis was about synthesis of KLTL specifications and supported by the [Reactive Systems Group](https://www.react.uni-saarland.de).

After graduation I started working as product Engineer at paragon semvox. We develop a personalized smart assistant that is used in top of the line automotive vehicles. My responsibilities include the development and maintaince of our internal prototype project that is used to test and demonstrate new featuresets before they are being brought into production. Additionally I'm the developer and maintainer of an internal test framework that is used to automate end to end tests in a customer project. This testframework mainly automates a variety of processes on hardware prototypes that are used internally to simulate a real-world car. The goal of this framework is to improve reliability of test results compared to manual testing and reduce the know-how that is required to work on the sensitive prototype hardware.
At work I write almost exclusively Java code.


## My Work Experience

In the future I might update this website with content related to my work. However, right now this page will remain mainly focused on stuff I have worked on during my studies.

## My Computer Science Degree

My main interests at university were the fields of embedded systems and operating systems and verification of such systems. However, I intentionally visted a broad selection of courses at university to develop skills in a variety of fields.

I very much enjoy the 'challenge' of writing 'low-level' code. In my time as a student this usually resulted in me writing efficient Code in C. Recently I discovered Rust which sparked my interest a couple of times already in the past, mainly because of the strong guarantees (safe) rust code gives by design while getting reasonably close to C performance. This time I actually gave it a serious shot and so far I have been really happy with my decision.

In my free time, I like to keep myself in shape by exercising regularly at home - particularly my back is very thankful for those breaks after hours of sitting in a chair. I would consider myself very passionate about a wide variety of music and audio gear, which also helps me relax after a long day of working if im not reading a book on my Kindle. One of my favorite things to do after university is to optimize my workflow, for the tasks I am currently facing. This mainly ends up in me fine-tuning my zsh, tmux, vim or vscode configurations to solve some annoyance I encountered that day.

I used to be a quite unorganized and spontaneous person, but a couple of years ago I read about the principle of "Getting Things Done" by David Allen. Nowadays there is no way I leave the house without a way of putting down my thoughts (usually ends up being watch or phone) which helps me to organize and plan my week properly. This step forward had a significant impact not only on my overall enjoyment of working but also resulted in me being way more productive in the same amount of time.

The only hobby that still survived from my early childhood is gaming. I have never really enjoyed single-player games, but always had a great time playing PC games with my friends, which I occasionally still do. I like to keep up to date with some eSports as competitive gaming still is a passion of mine despite not having the time to pursue in that hobby myself anymore.

Somewhat recently I have found a new passion: cycling and striving for improvements in that sport.

During holidays I love traveling to new countries and discovering new places I haven't been at before.
